# Welcome to the PyPSA-China (PIK version) documentation
This is the documentation for the China Python Power System Analysis (PyPSA-China) Model maintained  by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Studies' [Energy Transition Lab](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/labs/energy-transition/energy-transition-lab).


## Authors and Credits

The model is based on the PyPSA-EUR work by the Tom Brown Group, orignally adapted to China by Hailiang Liu et al for their study of [hydro-power in china](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.02.009) and extended by Xiaowei Zhou et al for their  ["Multi-energy system horizon planning: Early decarbonisation in China avoids stranded assets"](doi.org/10.1049/ein2.12011) paper. 

This version has been re-written by the PIK team. It is not yet published, please contact us in case you are interested in using the model.
